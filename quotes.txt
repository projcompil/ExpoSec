"What makes you think you can invent a good cipher if y ou have no expertise in the subject? Maybe you can, but it's not terribly likely. Imagine how you would react if your doctor told you "You have appendicitis, a disease that is life-threatening if not treated. We have a time-tested cure that cures 99% of all patients with no noticeable side-effects, but I'm not going to give you that: I'm going to give you a new experimental treatment my cousin dreamed up last week. No, my cousin has no medical training. No, I have no evidence that the new treatment will work, and it's never been tested or analyzed in depth -- but I'm going to give it to you anyway because my cousin thinks it is good stuff." You'd find another doctor, I hope. Rational people leave medical care to the medical experts. The medical experts have a much better track record than the quacks."
